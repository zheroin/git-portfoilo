<h1 align="center">ezProfile</h1>
<p align="center">A modern, responsive and customizable portfolio template for Developers!</p>

ezProfile is an easy-to-customize personal dev portfolio template that is created with React.js. When you manage the code in a GitHub repository, it will automatically render a webpage with the owner's profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories. Also it includes space to highlight your details, job history, education history, skills and recent blog posts.

It's all possible using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (for automatically populating your website with content) and [Article-api](https://github.com/arifszn/article-api) (for fetching recent blog posts).
